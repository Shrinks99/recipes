### Instructions

1. Cook potatoes in boiling water (about 25m for large potatoes), in jackets until fork tender
2. Allow potatoes to cool, then peel.
3. Shred in large bowl. (I like large chunks, so I break them up with my fingers)
4. Mix in salt, pepper and onions.
5. Stir in sour cream and 1 cup of of cheese.
6. Turn into casserole dish.
7. Top with remaining cheese and sprinkle with paprika.
8. Cover and refrigerate for a few hours or even better, overnight.

Preheat oven to 350Â°F

1. Bake uncovered for about 30-40 min or until fully heated and bubbling at the edges.

### Comments

The potatoes need to be big enough so that the ratio of sour cream to potato doesn't make for a soupy texture. 

### Historical Record

[From 12 Tomatoes](https://12tomatoes.com/potatoes-romanoff/): 

> The origin of Potatoes Romanoff can be traced back to the Strip House restaurants in New York and Las Vegas. Chef, John Schenk, created the dish for his restaurant, Strip House, based on the cheesy potato casseroles his mother made when he was growing up. The end result is a like if funeral potatoes got a bit of a makeover.

Funeral potatoes get their unique name from being a crowd-pleasing casserole served as a side dish at after-funeral luncheons particularly in the culture of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Who knew?
