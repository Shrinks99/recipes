### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375°F

1. Cream shortening and sugar in large bowl on medium speed of electric mixer
until light and fluffy. 
2. Add molasses and egg. Mix well. 
3. Combine flour,baking soda, spices and salt.
4. Add to creamed mixture. Mix well. (Dough can be chilled for an hour for easier rolling, but I don’t usually bother.)
5. Shape dough into 1” balls. 
6. Roll in sugar to coat well. Place balls on cookie
sheet. (Don’t flatten; this will happen in the oven giving that cool cracked
look.) 
7. Bake for 10-12 mins, or until set. If the cookies don’t flatten out
completely, when they come out of the oven just press them lightly with a
spatula.
