---

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 300°F

1. In a mixing bowl, combine butter sugar and cornstarch, blending well.
2. Gradually stir in flour.
3. Form dough into one inch balls (If dough is sticky, dust fingertips with flour.)
4. Place on an un-greased cookie sheet, about 2 inches apart; flatten top of each with floured tines of a fork.
5. Bake in the middle of the oven, 20–25m or until golden on edges and just baked through.
6. Cool 10m; then with metal spatula, transfer to wire racks to cool completely.
8. Store in airtight container with waxed paper between layers.

### Comments

The ratio of flour to butter makes for a melt in your mouth kind of cookie. Cornstarch and icing sugar help stiffen the dough.

The un-greased cookie sheet prevents too much spreading.

A flat cookie sheets without sides is best for even baking.

Try to underbake rather than overbake as cookies continue to bake after they are removed from the oven.
