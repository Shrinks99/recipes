### Comments

It was always a great day when this showed up in the fridge, usually in advance of Sunday dinner. Robin never knew the proper name of the recipe and thought it was called Green Grasshopper Pie, but that dessert, while also using chocolate wafers is a chocolate mint dessert. 

Currently available chocolate wafers may require adjustments to the quantities in the recipe. The original product was quite thin, about 2in in diameter and had a nice chocolate taste—a wafer, not a cookie.  

### Historical Record

Nabisco chocolate wafers were introduced in 1924 and were responsible for popularizing icebox cakes. Nabisco's parent company, Mondelez International discontinued the wafers in February of 2023, much to the dismay of the Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers Fan Club, and likely many other other more casual icebox and cheesecake makers. 

In July of 2023, Mondelez relaunched the iconic Mr. Christie collection of cookies in Canada. As part of the relaunch, Mondelez invites “Canadians to celebrate with fan-favourites like Peek Freans, Fudgee-O and Dads and get to know Mr. Christie again.”

Mr. Christie was licensed by Mondelez to make Mr. Christies Chocolate Wafers, but it is unclear whether the product is actually or easily available in Canada.
