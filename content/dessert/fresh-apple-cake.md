### Comments

Bunny Lawrence's comments on the recipe card:
- very, very good Mother Lawrence
- chopped pecans (I only had walnuts)
- apples (delicious) I just used apples I had, no particular kind.
- dice apples (I hope you have a chopper and a wooden chopping bowl)
- Here is icing. I never did get it iced. 

The recipe was typed with carbon paper. The icing was an addition by Bunny's daughter Barbara, written onto the card in ball point pen. 

Butter can be substituted for margarine 1 to 1 ratio.
