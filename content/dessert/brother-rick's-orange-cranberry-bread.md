### Historical Record

Rick Curry, a Jesuit brother and founder of the National Theater Workshop of the Handicapped [sic]`, has also gained a reputation as a bread baker. This recipe comes from the book, "The Secrets of Jesuit Breadmaking," originally published in 1995. At some point in the 2000's Robin got it off the 'Interwebs'. She wrote the recipe on a recipe card that already contained a magazine cut-out for a recipe for 'herbed green peas'. Robin has yet to make 'herbed green peas'. So whether that recipe is any good remains a secret, for now. 

The Jesuits had a lot of secrets, apparently. This Cranberry Bread recipe does not need to be one of them. Back into the 'Interwebs' it goes!
