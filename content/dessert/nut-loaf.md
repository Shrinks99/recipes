### Historical Record

When Grandma was in her 80's this nut loaf became a regular feature served with her afternoon tea at the oak dining table. Grandma drank orange pekoe tea throughout her life, always made in a tea pot and served in tea cups. She also gave away many nut loaves as a thank you or just because she felt like it. She often joked about the hundreds of nut loaves she likely made during that period of her life.
