### Comments

Robin transfers the store bought pie shell to a pyrex pie dish because she has some nice ones and it looks good when pie is served at the table. If you bake your pie in the aluminum pie plates that come with the store bought crust, the 350°F bake time might need to be adjusted. 

Barbara Michel frequented The Cookbook Store a beloved store that was located in the Yorkville neighbourhood of Toronto. This recipe is from a book called "Old-Fashioned Pumpkin Recipes" published by Bear Wallow Books. Barbara gave the book to her daughter Robin as a Christmas Gift. 

### Historical Record

 Bear Wallow Books was founded in 1978, by a historian who lived in the beautiful wooded hills of Brown County, in southern Indiana. She was teaching at Indiana University and researching early American history, when she realized that she saw recipes everywhere she looked; on scraps of paper that had been carried by immigrants crossing the sea, by pioneers leaving behind families and friends to settle a new country, and in letters containing family recipes to be handed down to new generations. Recipes provided unique insights into history, telling about the culture people came from, their economic status, and the foods available to them.

 The rest, as they say, is history. When the historian retired, she had published 27 books, from Amish and Apple, to Woodstove and Zucchini. Her successors were carefully chosen. In 1998 Tom and Linda Wolfe purchased the business, and added more books, bringing the old-fashioned recipe series to 40 titles.
 
 In 2018, Tom and Linda’s oldest daughter took over the business. Ever a Hoosier at heart, Anne still has the books printed in southern Indiana, one of the most beautiful places in the world. But she now resides, as does Bear Wallow Books, in Providence, Rhode Island.
