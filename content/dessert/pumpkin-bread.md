### Comments

Robin: I have never used the walnuts. I usually tripled the recipe to use up a full can of pumpkin puree. This made two large loaves, likely needing the full cooking time, but it depends on the oven.

### Historical Record

This recipe was shared with Robin by Elliott Carew at a time when we were both trying to figure out how to get vegetables into toddlers. 

Fannie Farmer published her best-known work, The Boston Cooking-School Cook Book, in 1896. A follow-up to an earlier version called Mrs. Lincoln's Boston Cook Book, published by Mary J. Lincoln in 1884, the book under Farmer's direction eventually contained 1,850 recipes. The Fannie Farmer Cookbook was revised by Marion Cunningham and published in 1994.
