### Comments

Note from Grandma to her daughter Barbara on the recipe card:
"Barbara you can do as I do, mix flour salt sugar in pan, add milk stirring so it won't become lumpy, then toss in butter." 

No recipes for the actual Cottage Pudding (ie. the cake) could be found in our family collection. Pudding is the term used by the British to mean dessert. 

### Historical Record

In her blog, [Revolutionary Pie](https://revolutionarypie.com/2015/03/05/cottage-pudding/) freelance writer and editor Karen Hammonds writes:

> Cottage pudding originated in North America. The earliest recipe I could find was published in 1863 or 1864 in Godey’s Lady’s Book, a popular 19th-century women’s magazine. It was reprinted in Civil War Recipes: Receipts from the Pages of Godey’s Lady’s Book, a wonderful collection edited by Lily May Spaulding and John Spaulding.

Robin choose the cake recipe in this entry for its authenticity and simplicity. It was adapted by the Macculloch Hall Historical Museum from a recipe belonging to Louisa Macculloch, a British immigrant who settled with her husband George in what is now New Jersey in 1810. 

#### Original Louisa Macculloch Cottage Pudding Recipe

- 1 egg
- 1 cup of milk
- 1 pint of flour
- 1/8 pound of butter
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons full of cream tartar in the flour
- 1 teaspoon on soda in the milk

Louisa Macculloch did not have a written recipe for a sauce to pair with the cake.
