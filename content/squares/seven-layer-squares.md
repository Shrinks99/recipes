### Comments

This recipe came from Grandma (Bunny) Lawrence. Once again, it looks like we have Gail Borden to thank for this piece of 1960's childhood deliciousness.

### Historical Record

The web page for [Hello Dolly Bars in Southern Living Magazine](https://www.southernliving.com/recipes/hello-dolly-bars) offers the following explanation for the number of aliases that this dessert has:

> These bars go by a few different names, including magic bars, coconut dream bars, seven-layer cookies, and of course, Hello Dolly Bars. Recipes for these bars began to pop up in the 1960s, both on the back of the Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk, as well as submissions in various publications.

> The name Hello Dolly Bars most likely stemmed from the popularity of the Broadway show Hello Dolly, which starred Carol Channing around the time this recipe began circulating, although the connection is unclear.

> Hello Dolly name attached was introduced to the public in Clementine Paddleford's food column in The Week magazine on September 19, 1965. Paddleford featured a recipe shared by 11-year-old Alecia Leigh Couch, of Dallas, which she had learned from her grandmother. The recipe included the now familiar combination of graham cracker crumbs, flaked coconut, chocolate chips, chopped nuts, and condensed milk. The name was reportedly Alecia's idea.

In 1964, Gail Borden featured this recipe on the back of his label of Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk. It was called Magic Cookie Bars and still can be found on the labels today.

Hello, Dolly! debuted at the Fisher Theater in Detroit on November 18, 1963, directed and choreographed by Gower Champion and produced by David Merrick. It starred legendary stage performer Carol Channing as Dolly Gallagher Levi. The show moved to Broadway in 1964, winning 10 Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress in a Musical for Channing.
