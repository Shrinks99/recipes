### Comments
This recipe comes from Barbara Michel, but its origin is unknown. It was her go–to as an appetizer that came with pre-dinner champagne when she was entertaining. She also used pecans and almonds. 

Robin generally got in the habit of using almonds, which work really well. It makes a great holiday season gift in a sealed see-thru plastic envelope with a cute holiday sticker.
