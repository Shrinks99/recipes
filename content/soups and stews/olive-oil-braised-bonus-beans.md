Creates 4 servings

### Ingredients

- 1/3 cup of olive oil
- Rosemary
- Pinch of red pepper flakes
- 4–6 garlic cloves
- 1 (400ml) can of full-fat coconut milk
- 1 (15-ounce) can of chickpeas
- 1 (15.5-ounce) can of cannellini beans
- 1 Zucchini
- 1/2 350g package of extra firm tofu
- 6–8 fresh sage leaves
- Nutmeg
- Fine pink Himalayan sea salt

### Instructions

<!-- Original recipe

1. In a large flat-walled pan, heat 1/3 cup of the olive oil with the rosemary and red pepper flakes over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rosemary is crisp, 3–4 minutes. Carefully transfer the oil to a small heatproof bowl. Pick out the rosemary. Remove the leaves from the stem, roughly chop the leaves, then add them back to the oil. Season the oil with salt.
2. Return the pan to medium heat. Add the garlic and the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk, chickpeas and cannellini beans, including the liquid from both cans of beans. Add the sage and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Reduce the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced slightly, about 10 minutes. Using a wooden spoon. mash some of the beans against the side of the pot to release their starches. Continue to simmer until creamy, 5–10 minutes more. Taste and add more salt and pepper as needed. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, pick out the garlic cloves, mash them with a fork, and stir them back into the beans.
4. Spoon the beans into bowls and drizzle the rosemary oil on top. Sprinkle with the Parmesan, stir in the lemon juice, and then serve with crusty bread alongside. -->

### Historical Record

This recipe is a modified version of the one originally featured in Tieghan Gerard's _Half Baked Harvest Every Day: Recipes for Balanced, Flexible, Feel-Good Meals_ (page 145). The original recipe calls for fresh rosemary which you fry in the oil, remove, chop, and reintroduce to the pot alongside a whole garlic process where you cook the cloves whole, remove them, mash them up, and reintroduce them near the end of the process.

The recipe is delicious, but we've found this is a lot of rigamarole and of questionable value? This simplified version includes none of that nonsense and, in my humble opinion, tastes as good or better. It was Liza's idea to add the zucchini and tofu.

You can also add more sage leaves. It's generally better if you do!

Enjoy!
