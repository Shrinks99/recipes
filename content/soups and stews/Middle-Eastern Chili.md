### Comments

### Historical Record

This recipe was adapted for Liza's hardcore camping trip. She referenced this [recipe](https://www.fooddolls.com/middle-eastern-chili-recipe/) with some alterations of removing the meat, and adding more of her favourite spices. 

This is just normal chili, but with a Mediterranean twist, replacing the classic kidney beans with chickpeas and fava beans. The intoxicating spices will have your guests begging for the recipe after dinner.
