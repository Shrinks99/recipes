### Instructions

#### Step 1

In a medium saucepan, heat 3 tablespoons olive oil and the cumin over medium-high for 2 minutes, until the cumin is toasted and fragrant.

Reduce the heat to medium, add the chopped onion, about two-thirds of the garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, and a good crack of pepper.

Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and slightly softened.

#### Step 2

Add the sweet potatoes and cook for 4 minutes, stirring from time to time, until lightly caramelized but not yet cooked through.

Add the five-spice and cook for 1 minute, just until it starts to stick to the pan.

Add the orzo, ~1 cup stock and ~1 cup water. Bring to a boil, then cook for ~25 minutes, undisturbed, until the sweet potatoes have softened and the orzo is cooked through.

#### Step 3

Stir in the parsley, cilantro and dill, and cook for 1 minute more, then remove the pan from the heat.

#### Step 4

Make the peanut topping: Set the pepper flakes, sugar and the remaining garlic in a small heatproof bowl. Place the peanuts and 3 tablespoons olive oil in a small pan over medium-high heat. Cook for 1â€“2 minutes, just until the peanuts start to turn golden brown, then pour the peanuts and oil over the chile-garlic mixture. Stir to combine, then, once the mixture is slightly cooled, add the sesame oil.

#### Step 5

When ready to serve, season the stew with 4 teaspoons lemon juice from 1 lemon half, then ladle into individual bowls. Spoon over the peanut topping, grate lemon zest from the remaining lemon over the top of each bowl, and serve.

Originally featured in "A Soup for When You Just Want to Be Alone".

This was originally specced as a soup with about double the water. Chopped peanuts can be substituted for cashews.
