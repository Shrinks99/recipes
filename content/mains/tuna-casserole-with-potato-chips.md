### Comments

Grandma's recipe is a series of typed instructions without exact quantities. Fortunately Robin remembers making it as a child. Back then, potato chips were sold with two separate white inner bags inside of the outside bag. The recipe used one inner bag. The other bag helped create enthusiasm for dinner making. 

Grandma's recipe did not include peas which appears to be a feature of other versions. Maybe she didn't like peas.

Grandma includes the following note at the end of the recipe card: "Serve with salad, hot biscuits, lemon tarts. (I never noticed that last line before, sounds good doesn't it. Robin might like this.)"

Grandma's recipe called for cream of mushroom soup, but her daughter Barbara used golden mushroom soup and that is what her daughter Robin copied onto her recipe card before she went to University.
