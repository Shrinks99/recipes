### Historical Record

In the 1970s sitcom _Welcome Back_, Kotter, Gabe Kotter's wife Julie frequently makes her "world famous" tuna casserole, which is actually notorious for being so bad. As Gabe remarked to his wife during an argument, "Nobody puts prunes in a tuna casserole!"

Oranges good! Prunes bad! (or maybe not?)
