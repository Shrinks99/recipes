### Instructions

If using dried cannellini beans, soak for 12 hours prior to cooking.

1. Drain the beans and transfer them to a heavy saucepan. Add water to cover them by about 1 inch and bring to a boil over medium heat.
2. Reduce the heat to low and simmer very gently until the beans are tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed (this takes about 1 & 1/2 hours).
3. After 1 hour of cooking the beans, in a large, wide, shallow saucepan heat the olive oil over low heat. Add the garlic and sage leaves and saut√©, stirring frequently, until the garlic is translucent, about 2 minutes.
4. Add the tomatoes and season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer for about 20 minutes.
5. Add the beans to the pan, cover with the lid slightly ajar and simmer for 15 minutes.
6. As the beans cook, in a large pot bring 5L salted water to a boil. Add the rigatoni to the boiling water and cook until barely al dente.
7. Drain the pasta and transfer it to the saucepan containing the beans. Raise the heat to medium and stir completely to coat the pasta for about 1 minute
8. Plate and serve with lots of parmesan cheese!
