### Instructions

Preheat oven to 375°F

1. Heat oil in large pot over medium high heat. Add eggplant and next 8 ingredients (eggplant through crushed pepper flakes); sauté 1 minute.
2. Add rice: sauté 1 minute. Stir in tomatoes and broth; bring to a boil.
3. Add cheese and chickpeas, stir well.
4. Spoon rice mixture into a large baking dish (or two small ones so you can freeze one).
5. Cover and bake at 375°F for 40 minutes, or until rice is tender. It is usually done when almost all the liquid is absorbed.
