## Required Packages

This site uses Hugo as well as [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to manage dependencies.

In addition to that, you also need to have [Dart Sass](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#installing-in-a-development-environment) installed using your package manager of choice.

For macOS, install Dart sass with `brew install sass/sass/sass`.  Install Yarn with `npm install --global yarn`.

## Building for Development

After downloading a copy of the repo, navigate to it with `cd`, eg: `cd /Users/Robin/Documents/GitHub/shrinks99/recipes`.

> [!TIP]
> After typing `cd` (the command we want to run to change the working directory) into the terminal, drag the project folder into the terminal window to get the full path!

If this is the first time setting up this project, run `yarn` to download everything required.

If the project is already set up, run `hugo server` to start Hugo on your local machine.  Navigate to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/) and get started!
