## Building for Development

This site uses Hugo as well as [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) to manage dependencies.

In addition to that, you also need to have [Dart Sass](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/transpile-sass-to-css/#installing-in-a-development-environment) installed using your package manager of choice.

For macOS, install Dart sass with `brew install sass/sass/sass`.  Install Yarn with `npm install --global yarn`.

After downloading a copy of the repo, navigate to it with `cd` and run `yarn` in the project's root directory to download everything required.

Run `yarn start` to start Hugo on your local machine.  Navigate to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/) and get started!
